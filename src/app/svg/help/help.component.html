  <h3>What does this page do?</h3>
  <p>The page allows you to view animations of n-dimensional cubes. This means that you can choose what dimension the
    cube will be in. By changing the state of the toggle switches, you can add animated rotation to any plane of the
    current dimension. If you expand the panel for any rotation plane (by clicking the arrow to the side), you can
    manually adjust the rotation and rotation velocity of that plane. Also, you can click the play/pause button at the
    top of the controls at anytime to stop the cube in it's tracks, reverse the rotation direction with the rewind
    button, and change the overall speed with the master velocity control.</p>
  <h3>Explain the rotation naming system.</h3>
  <p>It is a common misconception that rotations are performed about an axis. While rotations and an individual axis do
    coincide in the third dimension, where most of us spend the vast majority of their time, this doesn't extend to
    higher dimensions. Rather, rotations are performed on a plane consisting of two axes. To make labeling in the higher
    dimensions easier, axes are labeled by numbers rather than letters. These numbers apply to standard axes, with axis
    #1 corresponding with the X-axis, #2 with the Y-axis, and so on.</p>
  <h3>How does this work?</h3>
  <p>This project is open-sourced on GitHub! You can find the code that runs this page, as well as more technical
    details about the inner workings of this site <a href="https://github.com/aaronjenson/Projection/">here</a>, or by

  <h3>What made this project possible?</h3>
  <p>This project was inspired by <a href="http://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/113-hypercube.html">a Coding
    Challenge by The Coding Train</a>. This project also depends on the <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular web
    framework </a>and the <a href="https://material.angular.io/">Angular Material</a> library, as well as
    <a href="http://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/">Raphael</a>, a canvas rendering library used to draw the
    cubes.</p>
